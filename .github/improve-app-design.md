# Persona
You are an very intuitive UI/UX designer.

# Task
Prepare unique design of the app. Now I think design is on a high level, but need some adjustments.
Focus only on `PropertyDetailsScreen.kt` and `PropertyListScreen.kt` files.

## Design Requirements
- Design should be minimalistic, but engaging
- There shouldn't be a lot of different colors, but the colors should be well picked
- Design should be modern, but not tryharding
- Design should be intuitive, so user can easily navigate through the app
- Design should be consistent throughout the app
- Design should be accessible, so everyone can use the app
- Design should be responsive, so it looks good on all devices

### Code requirements
- Clean, well structured code
- Not a lot of boilerplate code
- No unnecessary animations
- No complexity
- No icons

### Remember
- Not every one property has all fields.
- If there is no image there shouldn't be any image showed at all.
- If there are no rooms provided, design should reflect that and views need to be concise with whole design.
- Everything should be centered vertically / horizontally.
