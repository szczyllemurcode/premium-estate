# Hello!

Only three files have been written by a human in this repository.
`README.md`, `copilot-instructions.md`, and `improve-app-design.md`.
All other files have been generated by AI.
The code was reviewed and tested by me.

I heard that you are also working with GitHub Copilot in your team, so I think you will find it
interesting. I will be happy to share my experience and discuss it with you.

## Why Copilot in recruitment task?

Like it or not, AI is the future. Companies will start to expect it from developers sooner or later.

## How was it done?

1. Start a new project with AS
2. Create `copilot-instructions.md` and review it with Sonnet 4
3. Create `### Task` section in `copilot-instructions.md` which includes:
    - setup dependencies, project architecture, DI, networking, models
    - setup UI with Jetpack Compose, view models
    - and more, but by mistake I didn't save it :)
4. After this, the task section was cleared, and `copilot-instructions.md` was a
   general-instructions file for copilot
5. Create `improve-app-design.md` with design improvement ideas, improved with AI suggestions
6. Run the agent again
7. Small fixes and improvements, general overview of the app

### Problems

- sometimes copilot was proposing too much, especially in the UI part
- sometimes it didn't follow instructions
- sometimes it was not capable of fixing some problem without making another one
